# Hi, I’m Hussainali Saiyed 👋

### Mechatronics Engineer | Process & Automation Enthusiast ⚙️

I am a Mechanical Engineering graduate from Sheridan College with a focus on Mechatronics. I thrive at the intersection of mechanical hardware, automated control systems, and data-driven optimization. Whether it's troubleshooting industrial pumps or building Python scripts to analyze data, I’m always looking for ways to make systems run better.
